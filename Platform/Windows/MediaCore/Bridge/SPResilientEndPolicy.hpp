// KhuaPlayer - pure decision rules for end-of-content and the audio decode failure signal
//
// Input to verdict only: no state publication, audio device, clock or DisplayLink work. The three call sites keep
// their side effects on their own threads. The rules are covered by the end-policy unit tests.
//   - Video path: reaching the declared duration ends normally (the position snaps to the duration); audio still
//     playing waits for the audio to finish. When video is exhausted, no audio remains and the position is more
//     than 0.5 s short of the declared duration, the outcome depends on evidence. Independent damage or truncation
//     evidence in this session yields PartialEnded (the declared duration is kept and the usable end is recorded).
//     Without evidence, after 0.7 s with no new content the declared duration is rewritten to the actual position
//     and playback ends normally. A declared duration longer than the content is not evidence of damage:
//     bitrate-estimated durations (ADTS AAC, VBR MP3 without a Xing header) and durations that include an unplayed
//     track (a Matroska segment duration covering a longer subtitle track) overshoot on healthy files.
//   - Audio only: a drained EOF plus an empty ring ends. A content end more than 0.5 s short of the declared
//     duration is PartialEnded only with independent evidence; otherwise the position is the declared duration.
//   - Audio decode signal: a definite error with no output, or output whose frames are all concealed, counts as a
//     failure; six in a row request recovery; any clean output resets the run and marks the session as voiced.

// Monotonically extend the declared duration when delivered content passes it (a stale sidx/mfra index or an

// declared duration at the end, and seeking stays clamped to the stale duration.
// contentSec is the actually delivered content position (video: presented frame pts; audio only: the smaller of the
// media clock and the ring's content end). The first extension requires exceeding the duration by more than 0.5 s,
// the same tolerance as the end rules, so end-of-file rounding on healthy files never triggers it. Once the declared
// duration is known to be stale (extending = true), it follows the content frame by frame, so the end position
// equals the duration without jumping back. Returns the new declared duration.
// runStartSec is the start of the continuous content run containing contentSec (see ContentRun). Only a run that
// crossed the boundary continuously from within the declared duration (at most 0.5 s beyond it) proves the duration
// stale. A run that begins with a forward timestamp jump (a bad tfdt or PTS pushing frames past the declared
// duration) is not evidence; otherwise a short clip whose timestamps jump ahead and back would be stretched and its
